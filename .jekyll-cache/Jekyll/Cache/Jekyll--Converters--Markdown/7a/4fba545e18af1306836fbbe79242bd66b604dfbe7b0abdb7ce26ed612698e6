I"Ú<p>Sustainable transitions are complex, wicked problems that transcend traditional governance structures. The scale of current ecological crisis, notably biodiversity loss and climate change, necessitate a level of societal co-ordination which has rarely been attempted. To efficiently coordinate responses from all levels of society, novel solutions must be realized giving room for synergies.
However, the organizations, systems, and processes that are currently in place to govern cities are complex and have not been developed to address the scale of the climate crisis (Wittmayer et al., 2016). Within urban mobility, car-centric development is understood to provide a host of undesirable effects on both the populations and the environment (Ding et al., 2014, Yee Van Fan et al., 2018). To be able to move towards a sustainable society and avoid catastrophic climate change, the number of cars and distances traveled in cars must be dramatically reduced, (Kuss et al., 2022).</p>
