I"¦<p>In the fight against climate change, cities have become a critical battleground. As innovation centers and high occupancy arenas, cities are hotspots for environmental, economic, and social issues. By 2050, two out of every three people are likely to be living in cities or other urban centers, and current estimates suggest that cities are responsible for 75 percent of global CO2 emissions, with transport and buildings being among the largest contributors (UNEP, 2022). Of course, the impact of the city is far-reaching beyond its borders and as such issues such as land conservation, biodiversity loss, and biochemical flows use are also highly influenced by cities.</p>
