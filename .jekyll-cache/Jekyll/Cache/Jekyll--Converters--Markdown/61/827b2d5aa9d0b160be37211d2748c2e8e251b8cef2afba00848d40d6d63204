I"ñ<p>The current silo â€™ed approach to sustainability in the built environment is problematic. Solutions which are created to optimize a specific system, have been shown to come to the detriment of others. A classic example pf which can be found in mobility planning, where an ever-increasing need for car lanes has pushed formerly public space into the hands of highly inefficient and polluting vehicles which are expensive to own and maintain and cause considerable environmental and health issues (Ding et al. 2014, Yee Van Fan et al. 2018). When issues like mobility are viewed wholistically, with a view to including health and environmental impacts, synergistic solutions such as pedestrian friendly urban planning become much more attractive.</p>
