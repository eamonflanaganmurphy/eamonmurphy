    <h3 id="blog-3-a-real-world-case-of-promoting-system-synergies">Blog 3: A real world case of promoting system synergies</h3>

<p>The current silo ’ed approach to sustainability in the built environment is problematic. Solutions which are created to optimize a specific system, have been shown to come to the detriment of others. A classic example pf which can be found in mobility planning, where an ever-increasing need for car lanes has pushed formerly public space into the hands of highly inefficient and polluting vehicles which are expensive to own and maintain and cause considerable environmental and health issues (Ding et al. 2014, Yee Van Fan et al. 2018). When issues like mobility are viewed wholistically, with a view to including health and environmental impacts, synergistic solutions such as pedestrian friendly urban planning become much more attractive.
In Vancouver, Canada, a particularly relevant case study on wholistic system synergies can be found when looking at neighborhood of Olympic Village. This development encompasses 1,100 residential units, area parks, and a growing number of retail and service and was built on a former industrial area for the 2010 Winter Olympics (City of Vancouver, 2014). Designed from the ground up as North America’s first LEED Platinum community (CTV News, 2010) sustainable synergies can be found in several initiatives within the community and the development is featured in C40’s Good Practice Guides (C40 Cities, 2016).</p>

<p>A particularly potent example is the high number of green roofs found within the community. These roofs serve several important functions. They allow residents to immerse themselves in nature providing mental health benefits (Rezaei, M., 2021), function as diffuse rainwater treatment and collection mediums (Berghage et at., 2009) allowing for non-potable water to be used for irrigation and toilets in the neighborhood (S.U.C.C.E.S.S. at The Village 2018), cool the surrounding microclimate protecting against urban heat island effects (Elmira et al. 2021), provide building heating and cooling savings (Bevilacqua, 2021), allow food to be grown locally reducing the need for vegetables to be imported into the city providing transport emissions reductions (Magalhães de Oliveira et al., 2021), and support healthy biodiversity by supporting local insect populations (Williams et al., 2014).</p>

<p>In the geographically close city of Portland, USA some these benefits are calculated to provide over $539,000 USD  in benefits over a 40-year lifespan of the roof, and the City stresses that green roofs on public buildings provide “an immediate and long-term benefit to the public.” (City of Portland, 2008). Notably these saving estimates do not include health benefits, nor the potential for green roofs to support urban farming or ecosystem services provided by increased insect populations. As cost benefit analysis’ are gradually expanded to reflect these and other notable benefits, it is likely that the economic case for green roofs will continue to strengthen (Teotónio, Silva and Cruz, 2021).
Beyond green roofs, the community also features other low impact development solutions to rainwater management, including bioswales, paving stones on roadways which allow for rainwater infiltration, and a naturalized wetland park – which processes two thirds of the rainwater that runs off of roadways in the community (City of Vancouver, 2019). This wetland park is home to a variety of waterfowl, birds, and a family of beavers (ibid.). Rainwater harvesting also cuts water use in the development by over 40% (ibid.). These features reduce the need for water treatment and storage in centralized facilities, give residents a sense of nature, and provide habitat for insects and animals (ibid.).  These solutions provide far more than just water management and reflect the growing understanding that synergistic and nature-based solutions can offer a multitude of benefits beyond traditional approaches.</p>

<p>Creating and fostering linkages between different levels of government and private actors such as water treatment (under the authority of the regional government - Metro Vancouver), healthcare (under the authority of the Provincial government), parks (under the authority of the City of Vancouver), and the local real estate development corporations (numerous private actors) has created synergistic solutions in Olympic Village which can serve as a model for neighborhood development within Vancouver, and in national and international contexts.
Ultimately this model can be used to create a city that is able to function as a holistic system, where different elements work together to create a more sustainable and resilient whole; a future which will be required to avoid a climate catastrophe.</p>
