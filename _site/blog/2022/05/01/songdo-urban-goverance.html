    <p>Sustainable transitions are complex, wicked problems that transcend traditional governance structures. The scale of current ecological crisis, notably biodiversity loss and climate change, necessitate a level of societal co-ordination which has rarely been attempted. To efficiently coordinate responses from all levels of society, novel solutions must be realized giving room for synergies.
However, the organizations, systems, and processes that are currently in place to govern cities are complex and have not been developed to address the scale of the climate crisis (Wittmayer et al., 2016). Within urban mobility, car-centric development is understood to provide a host of undesirable effects on both the populations and the environment (Ding et al., 2014, Yee Van Fan et al., 2018). To be able to move towards a sustainable society and avoid catastrophic climate change, the number of cars and distances traveled in cars must be dramatically reduced, (Kuss et al., 2022).</p>

<p>However, moving away from car-centric design may be easier said than done. Government organizations which set standards for mobility and accessibility are inertly risk-adverse and incorporate rigid organizational cultures, which stifle innovation and often have prescriptive requirements for all actors to follow. A potent example of the challenges in city governance and urban design can be found in Songdo International Business District.
Songdo is a purpose-built city in South Korea designed from the ground-up as a sustainable ‘smart-city’. The city lays 30 km southeast of the capital, Seoul on 600 hectors of reclaimed land on the coastline. This development project is estimated to cost in excess of $40 billion USD, making it one of the most expensive development projects ever undertaken (Gassmann, 2019).</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/photos/blog/songdo_location.jpg" alt="songdo_location" style="width: 100%;" />
Figure 1: Songdo International Business District (Araos, 2014)</p>

<p>As the city was built on top of reclaimed land with no pre-existing infrastructure it offers a unique glance into governance challenges. Without residents, or a pre-existing urban fabric, how could mobility within a city look? What would be prioritized to build an eco-city?</p>

<p>When being designed, Songdo set a goal of being an 15-minute city where residents can reach 90% of their daily activities by bike or public transportation in fifteen minutes or less (Poon, 2018). The principal developer Gale International was quoted as saying Songdo is “…a city that is compact and very much walkable, [which] is a direct outcome of this thoughtful approach to planning.” (Garfield, 2017) and when the project was announced in 2017, headlines proclaimed “This South Korean city eliminates the need to drive.” (Garfield, 2017).
Given the lofty goals of establishing an urban utopia where cars are not required, it may be surprising to learn that Songdo today extensively features large city blocks with avenues commonly eight to ten lanes.</p>

<p>Figure 2: Highways in Songdo (Kim, 2012)</p>

<p>These roads are the result of a mixture of design intentions attempting to take inspiration from the boulevards of Paris and Korean standards that mandate the width of roads. Despite a conscious effort to avoid car-dependent development, and with no pre-exiting infrastructure, how did this happen?</p>

<p>Decades of car dependence has shaped Korean urban planning regulations such that it is now impossible to design new areas without incorporating a car-centric design. Rigid organization structures coupled with trained incapacity have produced futures where despite best efforts, it seems impossible to break free of antiquated notions of mobility.
Songdo provides compelling empirical evidence that supports what Unruh (2002) has termed a “Techno-Institutional Complex” (TIC). In this case, the coevolution of car technologies and car dependence societies have served to create a car-dependent TIC with significant change inertia. This TIC lock-in, combined with trained incapacity and poor organizational management create silos where solutions to complex problems are created based on a select set of knowledge (traffic engineering) rather that a deep understanding of the problem itself (mobility).</p>

<p>In other words, strategic (how many lanes are needed to move a set number of cars) rather than systemic solutions (how can a city be designed to remove the need for cars) are offered which protect the status-quo and ignore potentially revolutionary solutions which require systemic restructuring. This reflects poor adaptive capacity within the regulatory structure, hampering efforts to effectively respond to shocks, in the case, failing to allow the design an inherently walkable city (Smith et al., 2005).</p>

<p>To realize additional synergies in the context of mobility in Songdo the interconnection that mobility has with health, livability, and the economy must be strengthened. Actors with the power to govern mobility must allow greater agency to those who would propose alternatives to the current mobility regime; moving away from prescriptive type regulations (e.g., there must be 6 lanes of roads) to give way to result orientated regulations (e.g., there must be mobility options for all residents). Otherwise, as seen in Songdo, outside actors who attempt to “… side-step incumbent regime members and foster alternative regimes will meet strong resistance by incumbent regime interests.” (Smith et al., 2005) ultimately impeding sustainable transitions.</p>
