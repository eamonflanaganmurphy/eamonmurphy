    <p>In the fight against climate change, cities have become a critical battleground. As innovation centers and high occupancy arenas, cities are hotspots for environmental, economic, and social issues. By 2050, two out of every three people are likely to be living in cities or other urban centers, and current estimates suggest that cities are responsible for 75 percent of global CO2 emissions, with transport and buildings being among the largest contributors (UNEP, 2022). Of course, the impact of the city is far-reaching beyond its borders and as such issues such as land conservation, biodiversity loss, and biochemical flows use are also highly influenced by cities.</p>

<p>A traditional siloed approach to approaching these issues has thus far provided the current paradigm – a world hurling towards a climate crisis with temperatures projected to increase by +2.7 °C by 2100 (Climate Action Tracker, 2021) in addition to a host of other undesirable outcomes. To address these issues simultaneously, system level thinking composing of sustainable system synergies are required (Buckler et al. 2014).</p>

<p>An innovative way to connect several of these issues, while allowing space for a social foundation has been created by Kate Raworth, a University of Oxford economist. She has created the “Doughnut of Social and Planetary Pressures and Boundaries”, or simply the Doughnut. The Doughnut is a simple way of visualizing the safe and just operating space for humanity. It’s based on the premise that the world has nine planetary boundaries that, if breached, could threaten the Earth’s ability to support life (as we know it). Inside of the doughnut there are twelve dimensions of the social foundation, which are derived from internationally agreed minimum social standards, as identified by the United Nations in the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

<p>In between these boundaries, the ecological ceiling and social foundation respectively, we have the sweet spot – or Doughnut. This is the space where humanity should aim to be, providing enough resources to support thriving populations, without exceeding the available resources on a planetary scale.
In a sense, this framework can be seen as a report card for humanity. So how does it look?</p>

<p>Figure 1: The Doughnut of Social and Planetary Boundaries (Right, Raworth, 2017), Planetary Bounties Quantified (Wang-Erlandsson, et al., 2022)</p>

<p>Humanity is exceedingly at least 6 of the 9 planetary limits and none of the indications in the social foundation have been met (Raworth, 2017).</p>

<p><strong>This is an image of humanity in crisis.</strong></p>

<p>What can be done about it? Due to this outsized influence on humanity, cities have the agency to massively impact the direction in which we collectively are headed. However, currently cities are fragmented into various departments each trying to meet specific targets with little regard to other departments and therefore synergistic benefits (Wittmayer et al. 2016).</p>

<p>Integrated approaches consider “…interconnections among infrastructure systems, sectors, levels of governance, spatial scales, and the environmental, social, and economic aspects of sustainability across the entire life-cycle…” (UNEP, n.d.). Bringing this type of systems level thinking has the potential to realize several benefits at once, bringing the sort of solutions that are required in order to address some of humanities most pressing issues. For example, nature-based solutions addressing stormwater flows such as reconstructed wetlands or green roofs can also introduce benefits in land-system change, biodiversity, and human health. Indeed nature-based solutions and blue-green infrastructure is also often touted for its ability to created sustainable and livable cities (Dushkova et al. 2020). If instead urban stormwater flows were managed through a centralized treatment facility, as is often the case, these types of synergies would not be realized.</p>

<p>Not only do interconnected projects realize co-benefits but they give rise to synergies, where the sum of the impacts is greater at the system level than individually. Given the growing number of social and planetary crisis’, these synergies can no longer be considered supplementary – they are necessary to avoid future environmental and societal catastrophe(s) (Buckler et al. 2014). To be able to bring the cities, and therefore world, towards the safe operating space of the doughnut, new urban governance models will need to harness social networks of urban innovation and pivot towards a new regime which incorporates system-level synergistic thinking at it’s core.</p>
